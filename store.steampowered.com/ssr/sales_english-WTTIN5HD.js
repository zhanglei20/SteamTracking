Your mouse companion watches, devastated, from your shoulder, the inferno of lost knowledge reflected in her tear-stained eyes. "All those books… why?"
    "Oh my God, you guys, a fire!" yells the skeleton evacuation coordinator, hurrying past the library. "Leave everything in your lairs and walk to the exit. Don’t run, Deborah! Like we practiced!"
    You follow the monsters single file up an emergency staircase and out into a clearing. Several goblins, clearly shaken, light cigarettes. "I think the mummy caught fire," says a ghost.

But your life was turned upside down once a talking sugar glider named Okada revealed the truth: You are actually the last living descendant of an ancient alien bloodline, and it is your responsibility to stop the vile machinations of the Black Lotus Ninja Clan. 
     After 200 episodes, several spin-offs, and an arch-enemy who ended up being your long-lost mind-controlled sister, you finally track down the leader of the evil ninja cult that you vowed to destroy back in episode three, for some reason.`,
