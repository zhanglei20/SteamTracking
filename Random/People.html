												Vitaliy grew up in the Soviet Union. He earned two Master's degrees (with honors) and a lieutenant rank. He solved thousands of differential equations systems, then architected and implemented software that has probably processed petabytes of binary data by now. And then, he moved to Santa Monica to help Sony lay the foundation for PlayStation-3. Vitaliy joined Valve in 2006 and helped us ship The Orange Box, our first Xbox 360 game. He went on to establish our matchmaking system, implement the PlayStation-3 version of our engine, and design and improve our numerous back-end systems.											</p>

Prior to joining Valve, Jay ping-ponged around the industry working with very nice people on games that were worked very hard on and then shelved forever. Prior to that he was an editor at the then-resurrected Cracked.com, and helped get that online. Prior to that he was Managing Editor of the National Lampoon. Prior to that he was mostly freelance writing, which is a professional way of saying he starved for a living. Prior to that he was a child, then a baby, and then hadn’t existed yet. That pretty much catches you up.											</p>
